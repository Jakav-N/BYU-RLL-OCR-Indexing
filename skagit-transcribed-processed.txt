employed for fifteen years

extremely successful in
both careers having attained
the highest enlisted

his retirement, "It is my
candid opinion that no living
person has more
knowledge and competence
in administering a
veterans' home than Gordon
Omdal."

Through the years, Gordon
enjoyed fishing, golfing
and traveling in his motor
home.

He had been active in Kiwanis
